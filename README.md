This is a set of go utilities you can use via importing `go.viam.com/utils`. 

## Development

We use [mise-en-place][mise] to manage required tooling and as a task runner. You can install it on MacOS and most Linux distributions with the following command:

```bash
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

Note that the install script will print instructions for activating mise in your shell that you will need to follow to get a working build environment.

Mise is also available in Homebrew and several package repositories. See the [official documentation][install-mise] for a list of installation methods.

Once mise is set up you can run `mise tasks` to view the available targets. Some common ones are:

- `mise r build` - Build protos and then go code
- `mise r lint` - Run all linters

## Examples

This library includes examples that demonstrate grpc functionality for a variety of contexts - see links for more information:
* [echo](https://github.com/viamrobotics/goutils/blob/main/rpc/examples/echo/README.md)

As a convenience, you can run the `mise` tasks for these examples from the root of this repository via:
```
mise r example-{name} {recipe}
```

For example, try running a simple echo server with:
```
mise r example-echo run-server
```

## Windows Support

Windows 10 22H2 and up.

### Development Dependencies

* bash (from https://gitforwindows.org/ is good)

Support is not well tested yet.

### Known Issues

* rpc: ICE between local connections found via ICE mDNS appear to be flaky in the establishment phase.
